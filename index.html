      <h1>Confessions for a city that forgets its soul.</h1>
      <p>
        A small, haunted press devoted to moral collisions, late-night prayers, and the
        oppressive warmth of a single lamp. Here we publish fragments for those who
        suspect that conscience is a kind of fever.

        <h2>On guilt as architecture</h2>
        <p>
          We build with guilt the way others build with stone. Each column is a confession,
          each arch a reluctant forgiveness. The city stands not on reason, but on fevered
          mercy.

        <h2>On the doubled self</h2>
        <p>
          A person is never singular. We publish the notes of those who hear their other
          selves whispering in corridors and on bridges, insisting that the heart is never
          finished speaking.

        <h2>On the underground vow</h2>
        <p>
          To remain tender is a form of rebellion. We keep a watch for those small acts of
          mercy that refuse the tyranny of the obvious.

      <blockquote>
        I am not even a spiteful man. I am not an embittered man. I am convinced my liver is
        diseased. Still, I insist on writing.
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Every Tuesday, a new letter emerges from the underground with a brief annotation.
